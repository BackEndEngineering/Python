                       Beyond PEP8

    To Pythonic or not to Pythonic thats Beyond PEP8 question.
Raymond Hettinger ponders that question with his video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M here. What I learned that
following the Python Enhancement Proposal that Python community supports
will eventually lead to The Zen of Python. But take careful heed to the
commandment that Tim Peters wrote or adventurally find yourself doing
the fireball run that everyone will know your not Pythonic ways.

    What I did agree with Raymond Hettinger is to keep it simple
and clean. This helps the Pythonic community and is a excellent
way of communication. If your Pythonic code is not simple and clean,
how are you expect the Pythonic community to help you. Yes, their might
be time where you will get sloppy, but your community with make sure to point
that out because that Pythonic way.

    Something you might want to adventure out a not Pythonic way.
To help you grow and experience what coding is all about.
To discover your true natural of yourself. To find the root of who you are.
Are you Programmer, Developer, Hacker, Computer Scientist, or a Coder that
can pretty much figure it out. It'll works, but it won't be pretty and thats
not Pythonic way. You might find yourself discovering your own world
and your be the creator to a new type of code that people will want to connect
to. Who knows, you might find the Python community wants to connect with you,
like the did with JAVA.
