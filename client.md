The technical skills I learned is having problem_solving ability,
communicating verbally with others and in writing through slack,
being an effective team member, ability to ask questions,
and what to be expected working with a client. Listen skills is
also a must to function successfully in a development team.
Listen carefully to others and ask questions to clarify othersâ€™
ideas and emotions. Regular open communication, in development
team to share their thoughts, ideas, and feelings, is a must for
successful development team. Unspoken assumptions and issues
can be very destructive to productive development team functioning.
What else I learned is getting to know your client and understanding
how you can be effective for them, to setup realistic goals and
setting up MVP for client. I found the most difficult struggle I had
during the client service week is to organized notes and being realistic on
setting up goals, but know after learning I know what to be expected.
